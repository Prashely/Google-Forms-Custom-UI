# Google Forms Custom UI  
**Easily Adapt Your Google Form to Match Your Brand's Look and Feel**  

## About  
Google Forms is a fantastic tool for gathering data, but it often lacks the flexibility needed for customization. **Google Forms Custom UI** solves this problem by allowing you to create a fully customized form that mirrors your brand identity, while still leveraging the power of Google Forms for data collection.

This project helps you build a custom user interface for your form while integrating seamlessly with Google Forms. With just a few simple steps, you can style your form, make it match your brand, and collect responses like a pro!

## How to Customize Your Google Form UI
Follow these steps to build a fully customized front-end for your Google Form, while maintaining the powerful data submission process.

### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Create a Google Form**  
   - Go to [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms) and create your form with all the questions you want to ask.
   - After you've set up the form, open the preview mode to get the URL. This will be used for submission later.

2. **Fill the preview form**  
   - Fill in the preview mode form entirely.
   - click on 'Get Link' below the form.
   - Paste the link in you notes app.

2.1: ***Extract the Form's Submission URL***

    Start with the Form URL:
    When you preview your Google Form, the URL will look something like this:

    https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdabKxN-FOcCQ6ts2UlRhBZevImBigv4P0XcnEsGUyqquxAFw/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.20089888=Prashely&entry.1785267775....

    Change the URL for Form Submission:
    To make this URL usable for form submission, replace the /viewform part of the URL with /formResponse. This converts the form into a format that can accept POST requests with the form data.

    So, the new URL becomes:
    https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdabKxN-FOcCQ6ts2UlRhBZevImBigv4P0XcnEsGUyqquxAFw/formResponse

    Use this New URL in Your Custom Form:
    This is the URL your custom HTML form will use as its action attribute. When users submit the custom form, it will send data to Google Forms via this submission URL.

3. **Build Your Custom Form UI**  

   - Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, create a custom form interface.
   - For each input field in your HTML, use the `name` attribute to match the Google Form entry IDs (e.g., `name="entry.XXXXX"`). This ensures your custom form sends data to Google Forms.

4. **Set Up an iFrame for Submission**  
   - Use a hidden iFrame to handle form submission. This prevents a full page reload and allows users to stay on your custom form page while the data is sent to Google Forms in the background.
   - On successful submission, you can redirect users to a confirmation page or display a custom message.

5. **Host Your Custom Form**  
   - Deploy your form on your own website or hosting platform, making sure the Google Form link and field IDs are properly set up.

6. **Test Your Form**  
   - Before going live, make sure to test your form by submitting data and checking if it appears in the Google Formâ€™s response sheet.
